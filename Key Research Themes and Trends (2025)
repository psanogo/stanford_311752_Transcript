Key Research Themes and Trends (2025)
Dominance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI Agents:

Applied Science heavily features research into leveraging LLMs and multi-agent systems for scientific discovery. This includes applications in cosmology, geospatial data discovery, atomistic simulations, organic chemistry, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), materials discovery, and mass spectrometry. This indicates a strong push towards automating and accelerating scientific research through advanced AI.
Software Engineering and Programming Languages also sees LLMs applied to core software development challenges, such as "Discovering Missing Peephole Optimizations with Large Language Models" and "Understanding and Eliminating Hallucinations in Large Language Models For Building Reliable Software." This highlights a critical area of research focused on improving code quality, performance, and reliability using AI.
Advancements in Quantum Computing:

The Quantum Computing category focuses on fundamental and applied aspects, including demonstrating quantum advantage through cryptography, developing certifiable quantum devices, building software infrastructure for quantum error correction, exploring quantum optimization, and nanoscale quantum sensing. This reflects Google's continued investment in the foundational and practical aspects of quantum technologies.
Core Software Engineering and Systems Innovation:

Software Engineering and Programming Languages covers traditional yet evolving areas like boosting vulnerability datasets, structured tensor algebra for sparse data, and E-Graphs for program optimization. These are crucial for building more secure, efficient, and robust software systems.
Systems research delves into optimizing operating system support for tiered memory, understanding host networks, and designing kernel fuzzers for concurrency bugs. The inclusion of "SERENITY - Enabling continuous and personalised stress monitoring with multimodal biosensing ear-worn wearable system" also points to research in novel embedded and wearable systems with health applications.
Insights from a Software Engineering Perspective
