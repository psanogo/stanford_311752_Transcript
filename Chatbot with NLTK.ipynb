    "NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a library in Python that provides tools for natural language processing (NLP). It is a powerful library that can be used for tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. NLTK also includes a wide range of text processing libraries, such as those for creating frequency distributions, concordances, and collocations. Additionally, NLTK has a large corpus of sample texts, which can be used for training and testing language models. Overall, NLTK is a comprehensive library that can be used for a wide range of NLP tasks and is a popular choice among researchers and developers working in the field of NLP.\n",

So before we start with any NLP project we need to pre-process it to make it ideal for working. Basic text pre-processing includes:\n",

So, your root stem, meaning the word you end up with, is not something you can just look up in a dictionary, but you can look up a lemma. Examples of Lemmatization are that “run” is a base form for words like “running” or “ran” or that the word “better” and “good” are in the same lemma so they are considered the same.\n",

    "After the initial preprocessing phase, we need to transform text into a meaningful vector (or array) of numbers. Bag of Words (BoW) is a method for representing text data in natural language processing. It is a way of extracting features from text data, and representing the text as a numerical feature vector. The basic idea behind the BoW model is to take a piece of text and represent it as a \"bag\" (or unordered set) of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping track of the occurrence of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the bag of words model, a text (such as a sentence or a document) is represented as a numerical vector, where each dimension of the vector represents a specific word from the vocabulary, and the value in each dimension is the frequency count of that word in the text..\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if our dictionary contains the words {\"the\", \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", \"mat\", \"dog\", \"rug\"}, and we want to vectorize the text “\"The cat sat on the mat.\"”, we would have the following vector: (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0).\n",
